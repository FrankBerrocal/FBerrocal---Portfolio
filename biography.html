          "Inspire others..."
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a human being in constant change, in permanent evolution. This quality has taken me through <em> unexpected </em> unknown roads. It has led me to meet extraordinary people everywhere around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retrospect, music has always been constant. I started learning how to play the flute at a young age, trying to decode 36 keys years later; adding more scales during my adolescent years. After that, strings from the bass and the guitar. Always struggling to find the best instrument, and even so, vocal cords were never part of my repertoire.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then, shortly after my forties, that I discovered my voice. I realized something: <strong>my deep voice has a purpose</strong>. And even more important than that: I liked my voice. I listened to others with similar voices also, singing notes that are centuries old. I fell in love with Opera because my voice fits, and I can be whoever I want: in Opera, <em>my voice is strong, has a message, coherence and destiny</em>. My muse has a thousand faces but only one soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had roles as a computer engineer, marketeer, project manager; but I don’t doubt it: my life’s third act will develop in the stage and everything related to it. My <em>biggest desire</em> is being able to inspire people with my voice. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Let’s sing.</strong>
