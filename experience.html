                After the documentation of all internal processes, I was selected as part of the team to provide virtual training to a new group of contractors in Nigeria.

                As a consultant for the Office of the First Lady in Costa Rica,  I worked with a cooperative of cocoa producers to create a feasibility study to help them request resources for the construction of a processing factory.   After some weeks of learning, visits and documentation a negative ROI was forseen for the study. In order to provide a solution,I was able to use all the vailable information on existing crops and land, and create an incremental project where associates and crops would be included every year, even calculating potential incidents.  Under this scenario, negative numbers would be present only during the first years to later provide high revenue to the institution.
